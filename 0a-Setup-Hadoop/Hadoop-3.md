# Improvements in Hadoop 3.x

Some of the improvements released in Apache Hadoop version 3.x include the following:

- **Improved Availability:** Support for more than two NameNodes: Hadoop 3.0 introduced support for more than two NameNodes, which makes the system more highly available.
- **Improved Monitoring:** Improved timeline service: Hadoop 3 improves the timeline service v2, which provides a unified view of application and resource usage across the Hadoop cluster.
- **Support for GPUs:** Hadoop 3 enables scheduling of additional resources, such as disks and GPUs, for better integration with containers, deep learning, and machine learning.
- **Vectorized IO API:** Hadoop 3 introduces the Vectorized IO API, which can significantly improve the performance of IO operations.
- **Improved security:** Hadoop 3 includes a number of security improvements, such as support for TLS encryption and authentication for RPC calls.
- **Enhanced scalability:** Hadoop 3 is designed to scale to larger clusters with more nodes.
- **Simplified administration:** Hadoop 3 includes a number of features that make it easier to administer, such as the ability to manage clusters using a web UI.
- **Simplified scalability:** HDFS Router-Router Based Federation (RBF): Hadoop 3.2 introduced HDFS RBF, which provides a way to federate multiple HDFS clusters into a single namespace.
- **Improved portability:** New File System APIs: Hadoop 3.3 moved a number of HDFS-specific APIs to Hadoop Common, which makes it possible for certain applications that depend on HDFS semantics to run on other Hadoop compatible file systems.
- **Better cloud integration:** Arm64 support: Hadoop 3.3 added support for Arm64 processors, which are used in some newer cloud instances.
